# Video Walkthrough 

A user and friend of the bot, NoLucksGiven ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKGNqcou80fr25rVjtkwhQ), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/nolucksgiven)), graciously put together an overview video that covers all the major features of PokeNav.

You can find it below. If you click through to YouTube, you can find timestamp links to quick tutorials on a number of features, including setup and usage, which makes it an excellent resource for you community to get up to speed.

Make sure you also read [the community setup guide](community_setup.md) if you are a server admin.
