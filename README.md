# PokeNav Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the PokeNav discord bot.

## Development

You will need to have a functional python development environment in order to properly test your documentation changes locally. Alternatively, for small changes you can fork the project and change in your master branch and create a PR request.

To setup a local environment, setup / install python3+ and then:

`virtualenv env -p python3`

`source env/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`make livehtml`

You can then edit your source and changes will be reflected locally.

## Contributing

Contributions are open to anyone, if you would like to fix a typo or make a small change, feel free to make a Pull Request and mention why you are making the changes in the PR description. 

For larger changes or if you are interested in contributing a longer form guide, open up an issue so we can discuss the guide, what you want to do before you invest a substantial amount of time.
