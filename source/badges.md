# Badges 

Badges allow community admins to create fun achievements for members to earn.

These are entirely at community discretion.

## Commands

```eval_rst
.. csv-table:: Displaying and Checking Badges

## Features

### Earning Badges 

Moderators on a server can use the `$grant-badge` command to grant you a badge you've earned. Once a badge is granted it will be displayed in your trainer profile. This only shows the last 8 badges earned as well as the badge count.

To see a full list of all your badges, use the `$badges` command:

```eval_rst
.. raw:: html

    <div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpCdaCNVSCM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
```

### Checking Available Badges

You can find all the badges a community is distributing by using the `$available-badges` command:

```eval_rst
.. raw:: html

    <div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wpeC75FllG4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
```
